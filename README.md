# mobile_resume

# App description
This is mobile app that displays details(name/nick,picture,social links,little detail about a user).
# Codebase description
The "engine room" of the codebase is where the width of the device being used is checked, to be able to layout the app components/widgets appropriately (whether portrait,landscape or bigger screens than normal mobile).
# Design decription
User's image and details(username, about user, social links, and what user tends to offer) are layed-out vertically when the app is in portrait mode and when the width of the device is bigger than 620pixels the user's image with the social links are layed-out vertically and horizontally with vertical layout of about user with what he has to offer.
# External library used
I used url_launcher from pub.dev to handle opening of social profile (Twitter/Github) of user when link is pressed.
# Features I will like to add
- Tracking user's job applications by saving details of applied jobs on the device.
- Adding a file/link to user's resume for easy accessibity when needed.

# Challenge faced
- My fear in mobile development is getting an eye-pleasing UI (if I am to get the design myself), but this task gave no room to doubt oneself, so I just made sure the requirements are met in the design I am to settle for.
