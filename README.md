# App description
This is mobile app that displays details(name/nick,picture,social links,little detail about an individual).
# Codebase description
The "engine room" of the codebase is where the width of the device being used is checked, to be able to layout the app components/widgets appropriately (whether portrait,landscape or bigger screens than normal mobile).
# External library used
I used url_launcher from pub.dev to handle navigating to social profiles(Twitter,Github) when links to them are pressed.
